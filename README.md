### Name: MIT Web Dev Exercise for Week 4 (files are labeled Week 3 due to MIT starting with 0 week)

Description: Excercise to have a pac man "chomp" her way across the screen and back by toggling images using modulo and a multi-dimensional array
===========
Installation: load files in preferred IDE - VS Code was used for the original coding
============
Usage: Review DOM, looping, and setInterval concepts
=====
Support: MDN and W3 schools contain detailed info on these concepts and an alternate pacman project helped to walk through DOM manipulation techniques =======https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOJBoGbRNQA
